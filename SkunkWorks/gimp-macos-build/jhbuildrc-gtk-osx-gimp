# All of jhbuild is Python, so there are all sorts of interesting
# things you can do to customize your build with python commands.

# The URL for repositories can be overridden. This is how you'd set
# your developer access to an SVN repo. It doesn't work, of course,
# because gnome has migrated to git.
#
# repos["svn.gnome.org"] = "svn+ssh://myusername@svn.gnome.org/svn/"

# You can set the default setup here.
#
# _gtk_osx_default_build = "fw-10.4"
#
# or set things up with an environment variable:

_jhb = os.environ.get("JHB")
if _jhb is None:
    # The default setup...
    # checkoutroot = os.path.expanduser("~/Source/gtk")
    # prefix = "/opt/gtk"
    pass
# Do note, though, that jhbuildrc-gtk-osx also uses $JHB to find
# another customization file that is loaded after this one. You can,
# of course, define your own environment variables for passing in
# parameters.

# The moduleset can be overridden.
#
# moduleset = "gtk-osx"

# As can the default modules to build.
#
# modules = [ "meta-gtk-osx-core", "meta-gstreamer" ]

# You can skip modules.
#
# skip.append("libglade")
#
#or put them back:
#
# if "libglade" in skip:
#	skip.remove("libglade")

# Uncomment the following if you're running OSX 10.11 or later and SIP (see https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/mac/documentation/Security/Conceptual/System_Integrity_Protection_Guide/RuntimeProtections/RuntimeProtections.html)
# causes shell-script build failures. You'll also need to edit those
# shell scripts to change the shebang from /bin/sh to $PREFIX/bin/bash.
# Note that /usr/bin/env bash won't work, because it will also strip
# the DYLD_* and LD_* environment variables!
# Note as well that any installed dependencies must use their full
# paths for their id (use install_name_tool -id to fix). Boost is a
# particular violator of this rule.
# if "bash" in skip:
#     skip.remove("bash")

# In addition, you can override _exec_prefix (used to set $M4 and
# $LIBTOOLIZE); by default it's set to prefix. You might want to reset
# it if you want to bootstrap to one directory and build in another
# (or more likely, several others). Mind that this is fiddly and
# requires tweaking a bunch of things to get autoconf to consistently
# find the right m4 files. Not really recommended. Similarly, you can
# override tarballdir so that you need download tarballs only once for
# multiple builds. This works just as you'd expect and can save quite
# a bit of time if you're maintaining several trees.

# _exec_prefix = os.path.join(os.path.expanduser("~"), "Source", "bootstrap")
# tarballdir = os.path.join(os.path.expanduser("~"), "Source", "Download")

# .jhbuildrc has a master function, setup_sdk(target, architecture)
# which sets up the build environment. You *must* call it in jhbuildrc-custom.

# Target is the earliest version of MacOS on which the result binary
# can run, in the form "10.X" or "native" (the default). It sets
# MACOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET and the -macosx-version-min CFLAG.

# From Xcode 7/MacOSX10.11.sdk on Apple has provided a new format
# dylib stub that links with dylibs from earlier versions of MacOS and
# has been tested to work back to 10.6 if MACOS_X_VERSION_MIN is set
# appropriately. Earlier SDKs lack this feature and may or may not
# actually work on MacOS X versions earlier than the SDK's; whether
# they do depends on whether the SDK contains a newer "compatibility
# version" library than the system on which you're attempting to run
# and which is required by your application.

# Architecture is a list for backwards compatibility; it can contain
# "i386" and/or "x86_64" and defaults to the machine's architecture if
# left out. Passing both architectures will in theory build a
# universal binary but this is untested. Since MacOS X 10.7 and later
# run only on x86_64 systems it doesn't make sense to change this
# unless you're targeting 10.6. 32-bit ("i386") programs run fine on
# 64-bit systems.

# There are also some utility functions which you may find useful:
#
# environ_append(key, value, separator=' '), environ_prepend(key,
# value, separator=' '), and environ_remove(key, value, separator=':')
# append, prepend, or remove value to/from the environment variable key
# with separator between the value and the existing text of the
# variable. This is primarily intended for manipulating search paths.
#
# append_autogenargs(module, args) and remove_autogenargs(module,
# args) add or remove args from the list of arguments passed to the
# module's autogen-sh attribute during the configure phase of the
# module's build.
#
# setup_debug() and setup_release() add either "-O0 -ggdb3" or
# "-O2" respectively to CFLAGS, CXXFLAGS, and OBJCFLAGS.

#  Set up a particular target and SDK: For default operation, set the
# architecture and SDK for the native machine:
setup_sdk("10.9","x86_64")

# enable optimization

environ_prepend('CFLAGS', "-O3")
environ_prepend('CXXFLAGS', "-O3")
environ_prepend('OBJCFLAGS', "-O3")

# Comment out the previous and uncomment this one to build for all
# systems running SnowLeopard and later:
# setup_sdk(target="10.6")

# Modify the arguments passed to configure:
#
# module_autogenargs["libglade"] = "--enable-static"
#
# or simply  add to them:
#
# append_autogenargs("libglade", "--enable-static")
#
# Note that in either case the args will be added *after* the args in
# the module's autogenargs attribute.
#
# Tell Git to use a different module and branch (not tag!):
#
# branches["gtk-engines"] = ("gtk-css-engine", "bzr")
#
# Or just switch branches
#
# branches["gtk+"] = (None, "gtk-2-18")
#
# Tarballs take a whole URL for branches:
#
# branches["python"] = "http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.6.4/Python-2.6.4.tar.bz2"
#
# Note that if the module has hash, md5sum, or size attributes and the
# branch download doesn't match, jhbuild will error out. Open a shell,
# untar the tarball yourself, quit the shell, and select "ignore
# error". Don't try this with modules that need patches unless you're
# sure that the updated version doesn't need them.
#
# Set an environment variable:
#
# os.environ["CC"] = "/usr/bin/gcc-4.0"
